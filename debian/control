Description: AVLDrumkits LV2 Plugin
 avldrums.lv2 is a drum sample player plugin written by Robin Gareus
 dedicated to Glen MacArthur's AVLdrums. This self-contained plugin
 provides a convenient way to rapidly sequence and mix midi-drums.
 .
 The AVLdrums comes as two separate drumkits: Black Pearl and Red Zeppelin.
 There are 5 velocity layers for each of the 28 kits pieces or drum-zones
 for both kits.
 .
 The main benefits compared to loading the soundfont into a generic sample
 player are:
  * built-in MIDNAM: The plugin informs the host about note-names
  * Semantic grouping of ports: fan-out separate mics to individual tracks
  * Compatible stereo/multi-out variant: Allows one to in-place replace the
    stereo version with multi-out. Start with stereo when sequencing and when
    moving to the mixing stage use separate outputs to process or customize
    level and pan of individual drums.
